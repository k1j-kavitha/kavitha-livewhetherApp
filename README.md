# 🌦️ My Weather App

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple weather app I built as part of my web development journey. The goal was to create something useful and visually appealing — and this app lets you check the **current weather of any city** in the world in just a few seconds.

## 📌 About the Project
I wanted to build something real using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, so I came up with this weather app idea.  
It uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch live weather data like temperature, condition (rainy, cloudy, sunny), humidity, and wind speed.
I also added a clean layout and used a background image to give the app a fresh look — something simple but nice to use.

Here’s the deployed version of the app (hosted on Netlify):

## 🔧 What I Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for functionality
- OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather
- Netlify for deployment
  
## ✅ Features
- Search any city to get current weather info
- Shows temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
- Handles errors if the city name is incorrect
- Simple and responsive UI
  
## 💭 Why I Made This
I’m currently learning frontend development, and this was one of my first projects to connect real APIs. It helped me understand how data fetching works and how to handle user inputs.

## 🙌 Thanks for Checking It Out
I’m constantly learning and building. Feel free to connect with me if you have suggestions or just want to say hi!
